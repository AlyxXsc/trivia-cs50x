# My CS50x Trivia Implementation

---

## Project Overview

This repository contains **my complete implementation** of the "Trivia" problem set from Harvard's CS50x course. This project challenged me to develop a fully interactive, client-side web-based quiz application. The primary goal was to demonstrate **proficiency in foundational web technologies** by creating a dynamic user experience where users could answer questions, receive immediate feedback, and track their performance, all within the browser.

## Key Features

* **Interactive Question Display:** Dynamically renders diverse question types (e.g., multiple-choice, free-text) and their corresponding answer options.
* **Real-Time User Feedback:** Provides instant visual cues (e.g., color changes, text updates) indicating whether an answer is correct or incorrect immediately upon submission.
* **Score Tracking:** Accurately calculates and displays the user's cumulative score as they progress through the quiz.
* **Client-Side Logic:** All game logic, including answer validation, score management, and UI updates, is handled entirely on the client-side using **JavaScript**, without requiring server interaction for gameplay.

## Technologies Used

This project was meticulously crafted using fundamental web technologies:

* **HTML5:** Provided the robust semantic structure for the entire quiz interface, organizing elements like question containers, answer buttons/input fields, and score displays.
* **CSS3:** Utilized for styling the application, ensuring a clean, intuitive, and visually appealing user experience. This included implementing responsive design principles for usability across different screen sizes, and dynamic styling for immediate feedback effects.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla JS):** The core of the application's interactivity. I leveraged pure JavaScript for:
    * **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically creating, updating, and removing HTML elements to display questions, choices, and feedback without page reloads.
    * **Event Handling:** Implementing listeners for user interactions (e.g., button clicks, form submissions) to trigger game logic.
    * **Conditional Logic:** Developed robust algorithms to accurately validate user answers against predefined correct solutions for various question formats.
    * **Application State Management:** Efficiently managed the quiz's flow, tracking the current question, and maintaining the user's cumulative score throughout the session.

## How to Run

To run this project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/your-trivia-repo-name.git](https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/your-trivia-repo-name.git)
    ```
    *(Note: Replace `your-trivia-repo-name` with the actual name of this private repository.)*
2.  **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd your-trivia-repo-name
    ```
3.  **Open `index.html`:** Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. All content and logic are client-side, so no server setup is required.

## Academic Context & Purpose

This project is my personal solution to the "Trivia" problem set from CS50x. It represents a significant learning milestone in my journey through web development fundamentals.

**Important Note on Academic Honesty:**
As per CS50x's academic honesty policy, this repository is maintained as **private** to prevent unauthorized copying by current or future students. It is shared exclusively with potential employers for **recruitment purposes**, allowing them to assess my coding skills and understanding of core web technologies. Unauthorized reproduction, distribution, or submission of this code to any academic institution is strictly prohibited.

## Learning Outcomes

Completing this Trivia project significantly enhanced my skills in:

* Building complex, highly interactive web applications that operate entirely on the client-side.
* Deepening my practical application of **JavaScript** for dynamic content and intricate user interactions.
* Adhering to best practices for structuring web applications with a **clear separation of concerns** (HTML for content, CSS for presentation, JavaScript for behavior).
* Proficiently handling user events and ensuring smooth, real-time UI updates.
* Sharpening my **front-end debugging skills** using browser developer tools to diagnose and refine application behavior.
